# simon-game
The Simon Game is a memory game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts with a short sequence, and with each successful attempt, the sequence grows longer. The objective is to memorize and repeat the sequence without making mistakes. The game continues until the player fails to correctly repeat the sequence.
How it works
The game generates a random sequence of colors (or sounds).
The sequence is shown to the player in a specific order.
The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the correct buttons.
If the player repeats the sequence correctly, the game adds one more step to the sequence.
The game continues until the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly, at which point their score is recorded.
Features
Random Sequence Generation: The game randomly generates a sequence of colors or sounds.
User Input: The player must input the sequence in the same order it was shown.
Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score based on how many correct sequences were completed.
Game Over: The game ends when the player fails to correctly repeat the sequence.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, including generating random sequences and checking user input.
HTML: For the basic structure of the game interface (buttons, score display).
CSS: For styling the game interface.
how to play-
When the game starts, watch the colored buttons light up in a specific sequence.
Try to remember the sequence and click on the buttons in the same order.
If you succeed, the sequence will get longer, and you will need to repeat it.
Keep going until you make a mistake, and your final score will be displayed.
