# simon-game
The Simon Game is a memory game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts with a short sequence, and with each successful attempt, the sequence grows longer. The objective is to memorize and repeat the sequence without making mistakes. The game continues until the player fails to correctly repeat the sequence.
